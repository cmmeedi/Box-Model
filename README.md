# Box-Model
Practice with Boxes 

A few simple boxes being filled with some Lorem text using Ecma scripts 'LoremX'
Added some different types of borders and what they do along with how they can affect the border size of a box
In addition to border style, width and color i've also added a few border radius augmentations.

Using a display: grid; framework i created several rows and 2 columns that are responsive to mobile devices.
The left columns title the topic and the right columns explain the topic in further detail.  

Border
Padding, Margin
Display, Units

Each of the topics are displayed within the webpage using the styling sheet.
